The MAX30100 is a Pulse oximetry heart-rate monitor sensor solution from Maxim Integrated. It combines two LEDs, a photodetector, optimized optics and a low-noise analog signal processor to detect pulse oximetry and heart-rate signals. 

There are a few break out boards available that make it really easy to use this solution. 

In this project I have tried to build a sample application using a 0.91" OLED display driven by the U8g2 lib.
